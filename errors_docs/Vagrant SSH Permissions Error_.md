# Ansible and SSH

This document explains how to log in via SSH from Debian 12 VDI into newly created VMs and how to manage SSH keys for secure authentication.

## üîê SSH Login from Debian12 VDI to VMs

If you've created a VM with username `vagrantuser` and password `vagrantpass` (or your own custom user):

### Option 1: Password-based Login

```bash
ssh vagrantuser@192.168.56.11
```

When prompted, enter the password:

```
vagrantpass
```

### Option 2: SSH Key-based Login

1. Generate SSH Key:

   ```bash
   ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
   # or better:
   ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
   ```
2. Accept default location `~/.ssh/id_ed25519` or `~/.ssh/id_rsa`.
3. Copy your public key to the VM:

   ```bash
   ssh-copy-id vagrantuser@192.168.56.11
   ```

> üîë After this, you can SSH without password prompts.

## üîê Ed25519 Token Prefix

When generating an SSH key using the **Ed25519** algorithm, the public key starts with:

```
ssh-ed25519
```

### Example:

```
ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIJN2f+1UcVfGHfJHTl8UgxFx9LtTwUVdf... your_email@example.com
```

* The `ssh-ed25519` prefix confirms it's using the Ed25519 elliptic-curve signature algorithm.
* It's secure, fast, and widely supported by modern SSH servers and Git platforms.

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting: Permission Denied (publickey,...)

If you get this error:

```
Permission denied (publickey,gssapi-keyex,gssapi-with-mic)
```

Make sure the VM has your public key added and the SSH daemon allows login.

### ‚úÖ Fix in Vagrantfile Provisioning Block:

Add the following in the VM definition block in `Vagrantfile`:

```ruby
node.vm.provision "shell", inline: <<-SHELL
  useradd -m vagrantuser || true
  echo "vagrantuser:vagrantpass" | chpasswd
  mkdir -p /home/vagrantuser/.ssh
  cp /vagrant/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub /home/vagrantuser/.ssh/authorized_keys
  chown -R vagrantuser:vagrantuser /home/vagrantuser/.ssh
  chmod 700 /home/vagrantuser/.ssh
  chmod 600 /home/vagrantuser/.ssh/authorized_keys
  echo "%wheel ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL" >> /etc/sudoers.d/wheel
  usermod -aG wheel vagrantuser
SHELL
```

Ensure the public key exists in the shared folder (like `/vagrant/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub`).

Let me know if you'd like to automatically distribute your SSH keys to all VMs using Ansible or shell provisioning.
